						<h3>The Brief</h3>
						<p>We were approached to develop an innovative hunting app for iOS and Android that would improve a hunterâ€™s chances with a large playlist of animal calls, an activity log, a local weather report, and a solunar times tracker.</p>

								<h3>App Development</h3>
								<span class="mini-break"></span>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>iHunt Calls by Ruger is an incredibly popular app amongst the hunting community that we have been privileged to develop. Since its release it has had more than 500,000 downloads and an average of 4+ rating, which we are very proud of. The app provides a number of features that set it apart from the competition including an impressive playlist with over 600 animal calls.</p>

						<div class="project-brief">
							<h3>Project Details</h3>
							<p>Hunters can gain an advantage with the solunar times tracker that allows them to predict hunt &amp; fishing times. The activity tracker creates a log of the hunt using GPS coordinates so a location can be easily marked. The iHunt Bluetooth speaker is the only speaker optimised to work with the iHunt Calls app. When paired with a phone it becomes the control and the app gives you the hunter the ability to create overlapping playlists to attract more game.</p>

						<h2>Client Feedback</h2>
						<p>It has been a real pleasure working with the team at Team 8 Digital. They combine a great sense of goal accomplishment with technical expertise to deliver real, business solutions. Our latest project has been the upgrade of an app our company purchased. The app had much more functionality designed into the iOS version than the Android version. To justify a price increase on Android we needed to mimic the functionality.</p>
