						<h2>Client Feedback</h2>
						<p>It has been a real pleasure working with the team at Team 8 Digital. They combine a great sense of goal accomplishment with technical expertise to deliver real, business solutions. Our latest project has been the upgrade of an app our company purchased. The app had much more functionality designed into the iOS version than the Android version. To justify a price increase on Android we needed to mimic the functionality.</p>
						<p>Along the way the Team 8 Digital team acted as a business partner, suggesting modifications which would be more cost effective or more user friendly. I&#39;m sure we could have found a development team in a lower cost country to do the basic code but I am also sure we would not have the ultimate solution we created.</p>
